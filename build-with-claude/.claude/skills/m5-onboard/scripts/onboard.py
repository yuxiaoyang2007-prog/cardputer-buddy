"""End-to-end onboarding for an M5Stack.

Detect -> identify -> fetch firmware -> flash -> (optional apps
install). Each stage prints its status so the user can see progress
over what takes a couple of minutes in total.

This is the entrypoint. Works on macOS (``/dev/cu.usbmodem*``),
Linux (``/dev/ttyACM*`` / ``/dev/ttyUSB*``), and Windows (``COMx``)
— pyserial abstracts the port-name differences, and the skill's
preflight checks handle missing dependencies (Python itself on
Windows via winget, esptool and pyserial via pip on any OS).

If a stage fails, the error message points at the specific
sub-script to rerun so you don't have to re-flash to fix a typo.
