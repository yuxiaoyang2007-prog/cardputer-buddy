"""Install a bundle of MicroPython .py files onto /flash/ on the device.

This is the second step after "flash firmware": it copies the user's
app sources onto the device so it boots into their software instead
of UIFlow's pairing screen. Think of it as provisioning the *payload*
that runs on top of UIFlow.

### Source layout → device layout

Two layouts are supported, chosen by whether the source directory
has an ``apps/`` subdir:

- **Flat (legacy, Basic-style):** every ``*.py`` at the source root
  is uploaded to ``/flash/``. The bundle is expected to ship a
  custom ``boot.py`` and/or ``main.py`` that drives the device, and
  UIFlow's own launcher is bypassed.
- **Nested (Cardputer-style, preferred):** ``*.py`` at the source
  root is uploaded to ``/flash/`` (these are peer modules like
  ``buddy_ble.py`` that apps import but which shouldn't appear in
  the launcher menu). ``*.py`` under ``apps/`` is uploaded to
  ``/flash/apps/``, which is the directory UIFlow's stock App List
  scans for selectable entries. No custom ``boot.py`` is needed;
  UIFlow boots normally and the user picks the app from the menu.
  ``/flash/apps/`` is created on the device if it doesn't exist.

The nested layout is what a well-behaved UIFlow app should use —
it composes cleanly with the stock launcher, doesn't overwrite
UIFlow's boot chain, and makes it obvious which files are apps
(visible) vs. shared modules (hidden).

Transfer uses paste-mode REPL with base64-chunked writes — slow
(~3 KB/s) but depends on nothing beyond stock MicroPython. A faster
alternative is ``mpremote``, but we stay in the dependency-free lane
to match the rest of the skill.

boot.py handling: if a root-level boot.py is being uploaded and the
device has a boot.py but no boot_uiflow.py backup, we rename the
existing one first. This preserves UIFlow's original startup so the
device can be reverted if the custom bundle is later removed. Once
a backup exists, we don't overwrite it — the first snapshot is
assumed to be the genuine UIFlow boot and later states are
derivative. Nested-layout bundles don't ship a boot.py, so this
path is skipped cleanly.

    Why this matters: with ``boot_option=1`` (the default on a freshly
    flashed device), UIFlow starts a background BLE advertise for
    flow.m5stack.com pairing. On ESP32-S3 Cardputer-Adv that
    background advertise wedges the NimBLE controller so that every

    UIFlow's boot.py hand straight to ``/flash/main.py`` without
