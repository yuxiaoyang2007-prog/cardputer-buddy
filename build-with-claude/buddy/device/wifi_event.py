"""Connect to the event WiFi network on boot.

This module hardcodes the SSID and password for a SPECIFIC EVENT
network. It is **not** a leaked credential — the AP is publicly
broadcast at the venue, the password is the published handout, and
the bundle ships with both baked in so attendees don't have to type
anything to get on the network.

The credentials below are intentionally part of the public repo for
the event-bundle case. To use this bundle elsewhere:

  - Replace ``SSID`` / ``PASSWORD`` with your own, OR
  - Remove the ``wifi_event.connect_with_splash(...)`` call from
    ``main.py`` to disable the auto-connect entirely.

The module deliberately does NOT touch NVS. UIFlow's startup reads
WiFi creds from NVS keys (``ssid0``, ``pswd0``, ``net_mode``,
etc.); we set ``boot_option=2`` to bypass UIFlow's launcher, so
those keys may or may not be honored depending on UIFlow's exact
boot path. Doing the connect in pure Python from our own ``main.py``
is deterministic regardless of that.
"""

# --- WIFI CONFIG --------------------------------------------------------
# Credentials live in wifi_secret.py (gitignored, keeps the WiFi password
# out of version control). Falls back to placeholders if it's absent so the
# bundle still imports cleanly.

    from wifi_secret import SSID, PASSWORD
except ImportError:
    SSID = "your-ssid"
    PASSWORD = "your-password"
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------

# How long to wait for an IP before giving up. The venue network is
# 2.4 GHz; on a fresh boot the WLAN chip needs a few seconds to scan
# and associate. 8 s is generous without being annoying if the
# network isn't actually present (e.g. running this code at home).
