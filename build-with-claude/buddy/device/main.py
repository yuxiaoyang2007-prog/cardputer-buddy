"""Custom launcher for the Cardputer-Adv buddy bundle.

Why this exists: UIFlow 2.0's stock launcher (startup/cardputeradv/apps/
app_list.py) runs a background BLE advertise for flow.m5stack.com
pairing before handing control to a user app. On this ESP32-S3 build,
once that advertise has run the NimBLE controller rejects any
subsequent ``gap_advertise(adv_data=...)`` call with OSError -519
("Memory Capacity Exceeded"), regardless of payload shape, until
reboot. The result is that our BLE peripherals (Claude Buddy) fall
back to empty advertising — discoverable only to permissive scanners
like LightBlue and invisible to iOS / the desktop Claude Buddy app.

The fix is to skip UIFlow's launcher entirely: set the NVS
``boot_option`` to 2 ("user app mode") so UIFlow's boot.py calls
``/flash/main.py`` instead of starting its framework, and have
``main.py`` show our own menu that hands off to the selected app
without touching BLE. UIFlow's BLE code never runs, the stack stays
pristine, and our adv_data payload works on first try.

Menu items are the three ``.py`` files in ``/flash/apps/``. Selection
is driven by the matrix keyboard — arrow keys (``;`` up / ``.`` down,
matching the Cardputer-Adv's labeled arrow cluster) scroll the
highlight, Enter launches. The launched app exits via
``machine.reset()`` (same pattern every Buddy-bundle app uses), which
reboots the device and brings us back to this launcher cleanly — no
"return from app" protocol to maintain.

Layout mirrors the app suite: 20 px DARK header, ORANGE hairline,
cream-on-black menu rows, hint strip at the bottom. Consistent visual
rhythm so the launcher feels like part of the bundle.
