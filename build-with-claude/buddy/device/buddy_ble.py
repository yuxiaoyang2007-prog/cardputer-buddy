"""Nordic UART Service (NUS) peripheral — UNAUTHENTICATED on UIFlow 2.0.

The Claude Buddy wire protocol is Nordic UART (line-delimited UTF-8
JSON with '\\n' terminators). On a build with the MicroPython BLE
pairing API, this layer would drive a DisplayOnly passkey flow and
require an encrypted+MITM link before dispatching writes. UIFlow 2.0
ships a stripped MicroPython BLE that exposes neither the
encrypted-flag characteristic setters nor the IO_CAPABILITY config,
so the link this module actually offers is plain GATT — any BLE
central in range can write to the RX characteristic and read TX
notifications. The encryption-flag and passkey IRQ branches below
stay in the file so they light up automatically on any future build
that restores the pairing API; today they are dormant and
``pairing_supported`` is hard-coded False.

Defenses on this build live above the BLE layer:

- The file-receive protocol (``char_*``/``file``/``chunk``/
  ``file_end``) is rejected outright — see ``buddy_chars.py``.
- Destructive control commands (currently just ``unpair``) require
  on-device button confirmation before they take effect — see
  ``buddy_protocol.py``.
- ``status`` / ``name`` / ``owner`` / heartbeats remain open over
  the unauthenticated link; ``sec`` in the status ack reflects the
  actual encryption state (``False`` here) so the host can render
  that honestly to the user.

Two implementation subtleties worth calling out:

- MicroPython's IRQ handler runs in scheduler context. Keep the body
  short: buffer bytes, split on '\\n', hand completed lines to the
  callback. Heavy parsing inside the IRQ has in the past caused
  dropped writes on ESP32 when subsequent notifications arrived
  before we returned.

- The advertising payload can't fit both the 128-bit NUS UUID and
  the full "Claude_XXXXXX" local name (3+18+2+13 = 36 > 31 bytes).
  Putting the service UUID in adv_data and the name in scan-response
  data is the standard workaround and is what the desktop side
  expects — it filters on name prefix via an active scan.

    Init ordering is load-bearing on ESP32-S3 UIFlow 2.0 — we paid for
    this learning debugging a day-long "device advertises but desktop
    can't find it" failure. The NimBLE build shipped on this firmware
    has a quirk where, after certain combinations of init calls, every
    subsequent ``gap_advertise(adv_data=...)`` returns OSError(-519)
    ("Memory Capacity Exceeded") regardless of payload shape. Empty
    adv_data still works, but without any AD fields (not even Flags)
    the device is invisible to OS-level scanners that filter on
    discoverable-flags — iOS Bluetooth Settings, the desktop Claude
    Buddy app, etc. Only permissive scanners like LightBlue still
    see it.

        advertising and drop the current link if any.

        gap_disconnect is asynchronous — the DISCONNECT event fires
        milliseconds later, long after this method (and buddy_app)

        _on_state("disconnected") → set_connection → _draw_header /
        _draw_main, which paints Buddy chrome on top of the launcher.

        We use three layers of defense, because the stripped UIFlow
        BLE stack has surprised us before:
          1. Set _shutting_down — _irq early-outs on this flag.
          2. ble.irq(None) — stops dispatch entirely if the build
             honors it (not all do; wrap in try/except).
